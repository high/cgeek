			<h1>
				My Life&trade;
			</h1>
			
			<p><i>
				This is my page about me. Now, you may have noticed that there is no color or graphics on this page. 
				The theme is inspired by the clean theme from <a href="http://mnmlist.com/">mnmlist.com</a> written by Leo Babauta.
				The purpose is that I want people to read what I'm writing, not looking at the pretty colors or the fancy pictures.

			<h3>New site up - 2010-03-05</h3>
			<p>
				Well, here is the new site. My goal is to make it as simple as possible and just display the things that are essential to me. There is no PHP or database
				backend witch means it is only one HTML-file. It is portable and easy to use. No GUI is necessary to read or write.
			</p>
			<p>
				Happy reading!
